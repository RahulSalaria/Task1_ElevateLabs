Port 21/tcp – FTP
  Service: File Transfer Protocol
  Risk: Medium, if anonymous login allowed

Port 445/tcp – SMB
  Service: Microsoft-DS
  Risk: High, potential for file sharing attacks

Port 139/tcp – NetBIOS-SSN
  Service: NetBIOS Session Service
  Risk: High, may leak internal network info

Port 1521/tcp – Oracle DB
  Service: Oracle database listener
  Risk: High, may allow unauthorized DB access

Port 8000/tcp – HTTP-alt
  Service: Alternative HTTP service
  Risk: Medium, could host vulnerable web applications
